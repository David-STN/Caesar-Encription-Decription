# Encription-Decription
Here are two files whose aim is to encrypt and decrypt any possible text. First you have to insert a text into the Encrypt file. Then copy the outcome and paste it into the Decryption file.
In order to make the code work i suggest not to use accented letters or weird signs a part form those included in the strings "alphabet".
I'd really like if you could suggest me some ways to upgrade my code or to optimize it
